## Troubleshooting
Things not working? Don’t panic—here’s how to fix common hiccups.

### Common Errors and Solutions
1. **Error: "No wireless adapters detected"**
   - **What’s Wrong?**: Your Wi-Fi adapter isn’t plugged in or Kali can’t see it.
   - **Fix**:
     - Check it’s connected: `iw dev`.
     - See loaded drivers: `lsmod`.
     - Unplug and replug it, then retry.

2. **Error: "Failed to bring wlanX down"**
   - **What’s Wrong?**: Something else (like NetworkManager) is using your adapter.
   - **Fix**:
     ```bash
     sudo airmon-ng check kill
     sudo ifconfig wlanX down
     ```
     - This stops pesky programs and frees your adapter.

3. **Error: "Failed to set wlanX to AP mode"**
   - **What’s Wrong?**: Missing `hostapd` or your adapter doesn’t support AP mode.
   - **Fix**:
     - Install it: `sudo apt install hostapd`.
     - Check support: `iw list | grep "AP"`.
     - No “AP”? You need a different adapter.

4. **Interface Name Mangling (e.g., wlan0monmon)**
   - **What’s Wrong?**: Monitor mode got applied too many times.
   - **Fix**:
     ```bash
     sudo airmon-ng stop wlan0monmon
     sudo iw dev wlan0monmon del
     ```
     - Cleans up the mess!

5. **Error: "Permission denied"**
   - **What’s Wrong?**: You didn’t use `sudo`.
   - **Fix**:
     ```bash
     sudo ./wifi-adapter-tool
     ```
     - Always use `sudo` for this tool.

### General Tips
- **Update Kali**: Keep everything fresh:
  ```bash
  sudo apt update && sudo apt full-upgrade -y
  ```
- **Reboot**: Stuck? Restart Kali to reset adapters:
  ```bash
  sudo reboot
  ```
- **Debug**: See what’s breaking:
  ```bash
  journalctl -xe
  ```
  - Look for `hostapd` or driver errors.
- **Beginner Tip**: If it’s your first time, test with a known adapter (like TP-Link TL-WN722N v1) to avoid headaches.
